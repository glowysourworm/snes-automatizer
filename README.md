# snes-automatizer
Compiler UI for SNES development. Repackaging and updating of BrunoRNS SNES-IDE.

# features
Simple compiler to replace the .py script from BrunoRNS (see subfolder) so that
the automatizer has a readable ordering list; and can show the output logs in the
application. The result should help you see what's going on during compilation.

# examples
The goal of this project is to be able to compile all of the examples from BrunoRNS's
subfolder; and then to begin putting together a (future) (very simple) IDE. The Notepad++
version was very inventive! There needs to be a little more control over compilation; and
then resources may be added to the IDE - along with memory mapping for the ROM. Essentially,
it should provide resource packaging, and compilation without having to re-configure all
of the compiler settings, write a make file, etc...
